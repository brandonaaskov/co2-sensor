## Second AI Prompt
I have a microcontroller from Adafruit, and I want to display some stuff on this OLED screen.

In the bottom right of the screen I would like to display the current time as (HH:MM:SS) using military time. It should update every second. That font size can be small. I would also like to display the text “1500 ppm” in large bold text in the middle of the screen. I would also like that text to be red.

I already have CircuitPython installed on the microcontroller. I just need the code to get it operational. Can you help with that?
