## Prompt to add a computer fan

*Note: not re-copying the code since it’s in the context history*

I have a computer fan that simply has a ground and a 5V wire. It can take 5V, and draws 900ma. I have an N-Channel MOSFET if it’s required. I also have transistors if that’s required. But if I can wire it directly to a GPIO pin, that’s great too. I would like to have the fan turn on when the ppm value is above 850 ppm, and turn off when it reaches below 750 ppm. Can you help me modify the code to support this? Please also let me know how I should wire up the fan: I have a breadboard and just about everything I could need to accomplish that task.
